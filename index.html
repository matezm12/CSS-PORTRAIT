I painted in space a radiant aurora In a tremulous sky of love and color, I joined nebulae with fascinating light And I put a better scheme to the cosmos I hunted the comets of blazing heat Putting their sapwood and ardor in mornings, I traced their important dawn in the sky And at night its major wake shone I covered the bright Moon with stars Glowing in the lagoon figure in candor, I dressed a good planet in an elegant ring Shining in stars of tulle glow I traveled to the galaxy with a brand new journey
In a celestial body of blue splendor, I gave galaxies an important lightning In agitated rain of magic in fervor I launched an eternal ray born in an instant In arcs of aurora from a superior Sun, And in sparks their disturbing light shimmered In lustrous powders of multicolored I created a meteor In giant beauty Plaguing outer space dreams, Dyeing in colors an oscillating lampo Hanging from the sky in sublime heat I forged beautiful nova of shining light Covered with aroma in flower perfume, And divine essence of penetrating smell It spreads on the planet, in green spell I I have only created in incessant gift The eternal cosmos of a great dreamer, Flaming the universe in the semblance of a lover
